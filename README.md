## Note on Formatting
The page formatting and divisions in these Markdown files **may not** match the book or PDF copies users have in hand.  
The original documents exist in multiple variants (e.g., initial draft copy, copy sent to press, press-edited copy, Bangladesh Government Press printed copy, Aditto Prokash printed copy).  
The text is effectively the same, with only minor variations, but structure and pagination may differ.

## Recommended Viewer
GitHub is **not** the recommended viewer for these files, as it does not support inline styling, which leaves certain stylistic elements unrendered.  
For the best experience, open the files in **[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)** with the following extensions:  
- **[Markdown All in One](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one)** by *Yu Zhang*  
- **[Markdown Preview Enhanced](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shd101wyy.markdown-preview-enhanced)** by *Yiyi Wang*  

If you prefer a GitHub-style preview, you may use:  
- **[GitHub Markdown Preview](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.github-markdown-preview)** by *Matt Bierner*

If you prefer a lighter solution, **[ghostwriter](https://ghostwriter.kde.org/)** by *KDE* is for you.

And if you have too much money lying around, choose (arguably) the best option **[Typora](https://typora.io/)** by *Typora*.
